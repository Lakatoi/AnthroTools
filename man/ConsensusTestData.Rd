\description{
This is some completely fictitious data made using the GenerateConsensData function. It exists to act as a template for the kind of data the consensus pipeline likes to handle.

NOTE TO BEN: If you wish to put a REAL data set in here, then we could do that. This is just here as an example, for now.
